This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library within Expo that isn't fully compatible with the version of Expo CLI or React Native you're using.  It's also possible if a required native module isn't installed correctly or is conflicting with another module.  The error message itself is quite general, making debugging more challenging.  You might see variations of this such as:

`Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTCustomView" was not found in the UIManager.`

This usually points to a missing or misconfigured native module.

Another common scenario is a problem in your `app.json` or `package.json` file, such as an incorrect plugin configuration or missing dependency.
