The solution usually involves meticulously checking your dependencies and configurations.  Here's a structured approach:

1. **Verify Expo CLI and React Native Versions:** Ensure you're using compatible versions. Check the Expo documentation for version compatibility.

2. **Check `app.json` and `package.json`:** Look for any errors in plugin configurations or missing dependencies. Pay close attention to any native modules listed.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding.  On the terminal:
   ```bash
   expo start --clear
   ```

4. **Verify Native Module Installations:**
   * If using a third-party library that requires native modules, double-check that the native modules are correctly installed.  You might need to run additional installation steps specific to that library.
   * You can usually inspect the native modules within the `node_modules` folder of your project. Sometimes a reinstallation is necessary: `expo install <module-name>`

5. **Check for Conflicts:** If you have multiple native modules, check if there's any version conflict. Consider using a version manager like `npm-check-updates` to check and update your packages.

6. **Review Expo Documentation:** Refer to Expo's official documentation for troubleshooting native module integration issues.  They may have specific guidance on resolving common problems associated with your particular native module.

By systematically going through these steps, you can pinpoint the problem and successfully resolve the "requireNativeComponent" error in your Expo project.
